## Reproducible Workflow

[Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JldKoA0zw)

## Definitions

*Reproducibility*, *replicability* and *repeatability* are related terms used by research communities referring to:

1.  the ability to re-run analyses or computational methods and get consistent or identical results (computational)

2.  the ability to re-run a study's methodology and get consistent results from running a new study by following procedures as closely as possible (experimental)

## Why Do Reproducible Research?

-   Public Good (Transparency)
-   Good for Your Future Self
-   Increasingly, journals require this
-   Recommended or expected by funding agencies

## NIH Requirement for Data Management and Sharing Policy (2023)

-   Data openly available for view and reuse
-   Require Data Management and Sharing Plan
-   Includes data storage, access, preservation, metadata, and distribution
-   Timeline: no later than associated publication or end of performance period (whichever comes first)

## Data Sharing as UMass (1)

[eScholarship\@UMassChan](https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/) can serve as a home for research data files 

-   support scholarly publications (dissertations, theses, and journal articles)
-   meet requirements for preservation/dissemination
-   free, managed by the library
-   large file sizes, many file formats
-   embargoes for access

## Data Sharing at UMass (2)

Also:

-   persistent identifier (DOI)
-   Creative Commons license
-   usage metrics (research impact)
-   metadata for discovery and reuse
-   another copy (just in case!)

Or see [NIH-supported data repositories](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html)

## FAIR Principles

![](Reproducible%20Research_files/figures/FAIR-principles.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **F**indable (unique/persistent DOI? registered in searchable resource?)
-   **A**ccessible (protocol open and free?)
-   **I**nteroperable (\[meta\]data use formal, accessible, shared, broadly applicable language?)
-   **R**eusable (\[meta\]data richly described with attributes, associated with provenance)

## Metadata

Answer the following questions and document:

For measures: the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How?

-   How is the data structured?
-   Why was the data collected?
-   Who should get credit for this data (researcher AND funding agency)?
-   How can this data be reused (licensing)?

## Don't Use Excel

In 2020, the UK COVID tracing program "lost" thousands of COVID cases when Excel ran out of rows. Data in csv format were imported into xls templates, which are limited to 65,536 rows. Any extra data rows were silently discarded.

-   Someone eventually noticed that they were receiving exactly 65,536 rows every day, 8 days in a row.
-   15,480 additional cases of COVID-19 were not traced during those 8 days. Contacts were not tested or notified.

## Github

![](Reproducible%20Research_files/figures/github_rstudio.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Packages

-   *docker* - lock down working environment with a Docker image (resistant to change in OS, R, packages, etc.)
-   *drake* - rebuilds intermediate data objects when dependencies change and provides visualizations
-   *rrtools* - instructions, templates, and functions for making compendia for articles/reports
-   *repo* - store R data files in central local repository with tags, annotations, provenance and dependence

## Compendia

## Tables with gtsummary

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| results: asis

library(dplyr)
library(gtsummary)

tab1 <- trial %>%
  dplyr::select(trt, age, marker) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = trt)

tab1 %>%
  as_gt()
```

An inline text example: The median (IQR) marker level in the Drug A and Drug B groups are `r inline_text(tab1, variable = marker, column = "Drug A")` and `r inline_text(tab1, variable = marker, column = "Drug B")`, respectively.

## Automated CONSORT

```{r}
library(devtools)
#install_github("bsgerber/ggconsort@370cb7119db5c8c2d63c737091a6b832194e899f")
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsgerber/ggconsort/diagrammer/consort_diagrammer.R")
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsgerber/ggconsort/master/create_status_tables.R")
```

::: panel-tabset
### Data

```{r}
head(status3)
```

### CONSORT

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

make_consort(status3)
```

## Plots with Real-time Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height = 4}

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

covid_cases <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv")

pivot_longer(covid_cases, 12:length(covid_cases), names_to = "date", values_to = "cases") %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  filter(Province_State %in% c("Massachusetts", "Illinois"),
         cases > 0) %>%
  group_by(Province_State, date) %>%
  mutate(cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cases, color = Province_State, group = Province_State)) +
    geom_line() + 
    scale_x_date(breaks = scales::breaks_pretty(n = 8)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = unit_format(unit = "k", sep = "", big.mark = ",", scale = 1/1000)) +
    labs(
      title = "Total COVID-19 cases by state",
      x = "", y = "",
      caption = paste0("Image generated: ", Sys.time(), "\n", "Data source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19", "\n", "COVID-19 Data Repository by CSSE at Johns Hopkins University")
    ) +

## The Whole Tale

Whole Tale is an NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Block (DIBBS) initiative to build a scalable, open source, web-based, multi-user platform for reproducible research.

"tales" are executable research objects that capture data, code, and the complete software environment used to produce research findings.

## Preparing and Reporting Statistical Code

-   Write for others to understand and for you and your team to save
-   Value clarity over brevity
-   Annotate the code's purpose and structure
-   Add English pseudocode to explain the purpose of each step
-   Embed supporting technical references

## Checklist

-   Think through the entire process - will everything be reproducible?
-   Is the data cleaning, manipulation, analysis automated?
-   Is there use of version control? Are prior versions easily seen?
-   How is software, hardware, operating systems, and library versions tracked?
